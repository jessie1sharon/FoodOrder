# FoodOrder

We have created a program where you can choose a dish of your choice (you have the options of hamburger, pizza, noodles, ice cream and drinks) and choose what to put on or in it, such as a hamburger without onion or tomato, ice cream with sprikels or not, pizza toppings etc.
You can choose how many different foods you want to order and in addition you can order previous orders that you ordered to save time.
You can cancel an order only about 5 minutes after sending the order because after that time the order has already been "sent" your way.
We used polymorphism and inheritance and implemented an interface and abstract class to execute this program.
